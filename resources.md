# Beginner books

## Tip for working through this stuff

Get comfortable with the JavaScript console in Google Chrome (or Firefox) and work through the examples there.  You
can't just read, it has to be interactive

Not to be skipped unless you know the basics.  Still, I'd consider at least more than a cursory glance at Head First
JavaScript

I read those YDKJS books before every interview.  They're what made me able to understand JS on a professional basis.
They're not long, but the concepts can be dense.  With all of this stuff it will take many reads to fully grasp it (grok
it we say in the industry).  That's okay.

# Websites

1.  [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

This will be your bible.  It has documentation on __everything__, from JS to CSS/HTML, browser API's, you'll live on
this site, trust me.
